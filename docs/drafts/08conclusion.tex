\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
Our contribution is twofold: for one, we estimate the conditional MPC out of the tax stimulus in the most precise and rigorous manner thus far. Second, we use an estimator that exploits the power of machine learning methods for causal inference and contribute to the wider understanding and promoition of this method among applied researchers. Machine Learning predictors are powerful tools when it comes to handling large data and/or complex relationships between variables without any specification of those. \\Â 
Our work strongly suggests that prior contributions, while going in the right direction, have missed heterogeneous patterns in the data due to their restricted estimation approaches or lack of better data. We most likely suffer from a similar fate when it comes to the latter. A more detailed and frequent availability of households' characteristics and financial standings (bad word) would allow us to more cleanly estimate the heterogeneous responses. We leave this as a goal for future work. \\
From a policy perspective, it might not be of interest on which exact sub-category of consumption people spend their rebate on - at least when being interested in providing a stimulus to the economy overall. Still, our analysis reveals useful information for making stimuli more targeted to be more effective or to get a general sense of what people spend additional income on, given their characteristics. Although natural experiments such as the 2008 tax stimulus and connected analysis have mostly little external validity outside of their context, the heterogeneity analysis provides a hint on spending patterns and reactions of households given their personal characteristics and financial circumstances. This can at least be a starting point when designing more targeted transfer programs.
