\section*{Estimation and Results}
\begin{align}
    \Delta C_{it+1}&=\theta(X_{it})R_{it+1}+g(X_{it}, W_{it})+\epsilon_{it} \label{eq:plm_C1}\\
    R_{it}&=h(X_{it}, W_{it})+u_{it} \label{eq:plm_C2}
\end{align}
where $\Delta C_{it+1}$ is change in consumption, $R_{it+1}$ is the amount of rebate received by the household and $g(X_{it}, W_{it})$ and $h(g(X_{it}, W_{it})$ are non-parametric functions of confounders. $X_{it}$ and $W_{it}$ are distinct by the assumption that only $X_{it}$ influences the marginal effect of the rebate, $\theta(X)$, while $W_{it}$ denotes the set of confounders that play no role in the effect.
