\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
(from intro 2 draft but doesn't fit that much anymore)
Our contribution is twofold: for one, we estimate the conditional MPC out of the tax stimulus in the most precise and rigorous manner thus far. Second, we use an estimator that exploits the power of machine learning methods for causal inference and contribute to the wider understanding and promoition of this method among applied researchers. Machine Learning predictors are powerful tools when it comes to handling large data and/or complex relationships between variables without any specification of those.
